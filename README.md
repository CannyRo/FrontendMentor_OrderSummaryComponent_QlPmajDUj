## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The breakpoints of the css libraries are not sacred, so I can choose different breakpoints to suit the needs of my project.

Here I've used the following breakpoints: 


```css
@media (min-width: 498px){
    /* When the max-width of card is reached */
    /* 100 vw = padding left of body + max-width of .card + padding right of body*/
}
@media (min-width: 639px){ 
    /* When the 100 wv reaches the minimal width of the background size
    Minimal background size : 
    width: 639.27px;
    height: 194px;
    */
}
```

### Continued development

Continue to improve responsive management by limiting the use of fixed width and height by using min and max.
